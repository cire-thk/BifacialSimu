 abstract = {bifacial{\_}radiance contains a series of Python wrapper functions to make working with RADIANCE easier, particularly for the PV researcher interested in bifacial PV performance.  Users can configure site details such as latitude / longitude, and ground albedo.  A bifacial PV system is created with a number of PV modules in rows.  The user can specify ground clearance height, row spacing, tilt and azimuth angle, etc.  The scene is created, and annual or hourly irradiance profiles are applied to identify the rear irradiance fraction for a given condition.},

@article{electrical_characterization,
abstract = {We present a method to characterize bifacial photovoltaic (PV) modules for simultaneous front and rear side illumination (i.e., bifacial illumination). The method uses standard monofacial (i.e., single-sided) indoor current-voltage measurements on the front and rear sides of the bifacial module, while covering the other side with a non-reflecting black cover. To define the performance under bifacial illumination, new bifacial parameters (short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, fill factor and efficiency) are calculated using a one-diode model of the PV module. Assuming linear current response of PV modules for different illuminations, the method numerically simulates the performance of bifacial PV modules for various combinations of front and rear side irradiances. The method is useful in predicting the behavior of the bifacial PV module under bifacial illumination, without actually measuring the module under these conditions. Using a silicon wafer based bifacial PV module, we demonstrate experimentally that the method can predict the performance to within 1% variation with actual measurements. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@inproceedings{Marion.2017,
 abstract = {A model, suitable for a row or multiple rows of photovoltaic (PV) modules, is presented for estimating the backside irradiance for bifacial PV modules. The model, which includes the effects of shading by the PV rows, is based on the use of configuration factors (CFs) to determine the fraction of a source of irradiance that is received by the backside of the PV module. Backside irradiances are modeled along the sloped height of the PV module, but assumed not to vary along the length of the PV row. The backside irradiances are corrected for angle-of-incidence losses and may be added to the front side irradiance to determine the total irradiance resource for the PV cell. Model results are compared with the measured backside irradiances for NREL and Sandia PV systems, and with results when using the RADIANCE ray tracing program.},
