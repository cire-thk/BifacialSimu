When enabled, BifacialSimu will calculate the ohmic losses due to the resistivity of the cables. This can be enabled for the DC, AC or both
cables. 
The following parameters must be entered for the calculations:


Average wire length:		The average length of the wires from the terminals of the PV array to the DC terminals of the  
				inverter in meters. 

Wire material:			A selection must be made between copper or aluminum wire. This will determine the resistivity of the material.
 

Wire diameter:			The most common wire gauges can be selected from the drop-down menu and this will load the corresponding
 				diameter or instead the diameter in mm can be manually entered in the blank field.
