The pop-down menu at the top provides several inverter datasheets to select from. 
Below, you'll find the options to calculate the inverter loss in the simulation by selecting enable/disable.

After choosing the preferable inverter module, the parameters will be automatically filled out. Or, a user has the option to input the parameters of their inverter module. 
It's important to note that unnecessary fields for the simulation must be removed.

Rated power:		refers to the maximum output power that an inverter can deliver under specified conditions, expressed in watts
 			or kilowatts. Also, it indicates the inverter's capacity and is defined by the inverter manufacturer.
	
Maximum efficiency: 	is the highest level of efficiency that an inverter can achieve under specific conditions and express as a
			percentage. The value is fixed and is referred from the manufacturer's datasheet. 

European efficiency:	is usually given by the manufacturer of the inverter.

CEC efficiency:		Inverter efficiency value would be referred from the manufacturer's datasheet.
			The value is fixed and is referred from the manufacturer's datasheet.

Weighted efficiency:	takes into account the variations in efficiency at different operating points of the system. 
			It calculates the efficiency of the system by assigning different weights to the efficiency values obtained at various
			operating conditions. The values are referred to from the graph shown in the inverter datasheet. The user would input
			those values in the following two columns of data.

adjustable parameters: 

                            Efficiency range:           - Ranges for inverter efficinecy input
                            Efficiency values:          - Efficiency value for respective range
