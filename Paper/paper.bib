@article{VF_validation,
abstract = {In this paper, we use a model based on view factors to estimate the irradiance incident on both surfaces of a singleaxis tracker PV array for given direct and diffuse light components of the sky dome. We describe the mathematical formulation of the view factor model that assumes a 2D tracker geometry with Lambertian surfaces while accounting for reflections from all surrounding surfaces. The model allows specifically to calculate the incident irradiance on the back surface of PV modules as well as the diffuse shading effects caused by the presence of neighboring tracker rows in a PV array. We present preliminary results on an experimental validation of the view factor model.},

Users can configure site details such as latitude / longitude, and ground albedo.  A bifacial PV system is created with a number of PV modules in rows.  The user can specify ground clearance height, row spacing, tilt and azimuth angle, etc.  The scene is created, and annual or hourly irradiance profiles are applied to identify the rear irradiance fraction for a given condition.},

@article{model_validation,
abstract = {Models predicting rear irradiance for bifacial systems are critical to establish accurate estimates of energy yield. Here, we compare five published bifacial irradiance models, varying clearance, row spacing, tilt, and albedo to measure the sensitivity to these parameters. Bifacial energy gains (BGE) as high as 20% are predicted for some configurations. Model agreement is generally good for low ground clearance (clearance heights lower than 0.75 times the collector width), but at higher clearances, finite system size and edge effects become a significant factor in simulations, stretching assumptions of infinite system extent made in some models. In addition, rear irradiance uniformity is improved at high ground clearance, as expected. A test-bed construction and results are described for comparison between modeled and measured data in Golden, CO, USA. The investigations indicate that model agreement for BGE calculation is better than 2% (absolute) when compared with measured results, depending on the system configuration.},

 abstract = {A model, suitable for a row or multiple rows of photovoltaic (PV) modules, is presented for estimating the backside irradiance for bifacial PV modules. The model, which includes the effects of shading by the PV rows, is based on the use of configuration factors (CFs) to determine the fraction of a source of irradiance that is received by the backside of the PV module. Backside irradiances are modeled along the sloped height of the PV module, but assumed not to vary along the length of the PV row. The backside irradiances are corrected for angle-of-incidence losses and may be added to the front side irradiance to determine the total irradiance resource for the PV cell. Model results are compared with the measured backside irradiances for NREL and Sandia PV systems, and with results when using the RADIANCE ray tracing program.},
